        Technical articles written by humans have been a guiding star from my very first hours using Unreal Engine. As the internet grinds to a halt, I find them more useful than ever. It is high time I join the ranks and do my part to help.

        I've always enjoyed making things myself. It's time consuming and frustrating at times but I wouldn't have it any other way. As it often goes with doing something for the first time, this website isn't perfect. However, I know I did my absolute best and it will continue to grow and improve with my skills. The articles contained within are also written by meâ€”a skill I hope to hone as I go along.

        If you happen to be a fellow human, thank you for visiting! I hope you find something useful here.

        One fun thing about doing things yourself is that you can hardly ever do much alone. I am grateful to have infrastructure to use and examples to learn from.
