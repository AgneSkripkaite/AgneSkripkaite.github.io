    <p class="paragraph">
        Technical articles written by humans have been a guiding star from my very first hours using Unreal Engine. As the internet grinds to a halt, I find them more useful than ever. It is high time I join the ranks and do my part to help.

    <p class="paragraph">
        I've always enjoyed making things. It can be slow and occasionally frustrating but I wouldn't have it any other way. As it often goes with doing something for the first time, this website isn't perfect. However, I know I did my best and it will continue to grow and improve with my skills. The articles contained within are also written by meâ€”a skill I hope to hone as I go along. Thus, I will not be using any artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) systems to help me write. I also do not consent to have any of the contents of this website used for any AI or ML purposes unless I have explicitly stated otherwise for a particular use (and that use only).

        If you happen to be a fellow human, thank you for visiting! I hope you find something useful here.

        One fun thing about making things is that you can hardly ever do much alone. I am grateful to have infrastructure to use and examples to learn from.
