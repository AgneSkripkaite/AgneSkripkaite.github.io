## Agne's Personal Website

Hi! This is the repo for my personal website. You're welcome to look and copy, but I have no web dev experience so things may be jank. You have been warned!

The base Jekyll and Tailwind setup for this website was adapted from Stanislav Katkov's [jekyll-tailwind-cli-template](https://github.com/skatkov/jekyll-tailwind-cli-template).

Special thanks to Ryan Chang for the [guide on using GitHub Actions](https://www.ryancyq.com/posts/2024/07/30/deploy-jekyll-with-tailwindcss-via-github-actions) that helped me get this to work on Github Pages.

Font is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/) because it is neat and more folks need to know about it!
