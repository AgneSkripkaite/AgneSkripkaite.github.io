<p class="paragraph paragraph-spacer">
  It's hard learning new things and if you're here I assume you've already taken
  the first steps. While those may have been the easiest steps in the journey
  ahead, the good news is the world is full of Unreal Engine resources and
  wonderful Unreal Engine devs happy to help you along the way. Welcome! I can't
  wait to see what you make!
</p>

<h2 class="heading2" id="community">Community</h2>
<hr class="heading-divider" />

<p class="paragraph paragraph-spacer">
  The first and most important piece of advice I can give you is to avoid trying
  to stick it out alone. You are much more likely to succeed and have a good
  time along the way if you find a community and have places to ask for help
  when you get stuck. Networking shouldn't be an afterthought neglected until
  you think you are skilled enough to find a job. It's not how it works anyway.
  I prefer to call it making friends with folks who also do cool things. It's a
  way to get inspired and motivated, a way to magically absorb knowledge you
  otherwise would have never thought to learn, and then, and only then, if you
  get very lucky, it might lead to a job.
</p>

<p class="paragraph paragraph-spacer">
  Long story short, making friends who also use UE should be as high on the
  priority list as learning technical skills of using UE. I don't want to hear
  you saying you're not good at it. It's a skill like any other, you have to be
  bad at it before you can be good at it. The sections below give you advice on
  where to start.
</p>

<h3 class="heading3" id="online-communities">Online Communities</h3>

<p class="paragraph paragraph-spacer">
  Assuming nobody printed this page out and handed it to you, you're reading
  this article on the internet. So you don't really have an excuse not to join
  any online communities. Though keep in mind that lurking, while perfectly
  valid, will never be as beneficial as actually participating. Find the spaces
  you feel most comfortable in and do your best.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  There are too many communities out there to make a comprehensive list, so
  here's a few to get you started:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-7 paragraph-spacer">
  <li>
    <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community/" class="text-link"
      >Official Unreal Engine Community Forum</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://discord.com/invite/qjZAcSWpJz" class="text-link"
      >Epic for Indies Discord</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://discord.com/invite/unrealsource" class="text-link"
      >Unreal Source Discord</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://bsky.app/profile/urmultimedia.bsky.social/feed/aaai744hfpbh6"
      class="text-link"
      >Unreal Engine 5 Feed on Bluesky</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="heading3" id="in-person-communities">In-person Communities</h3>

<p class="paragraph paragraph-spacer">
  If meeting people in person is at all an option for you, you should at least
  try. Online communities are great but friendships form so much faster and
  stronger in person.
</p>

<p class="paragraph paragraph-spacer">
  For UE specific local communities, start by checking
  <a href="https://communities.unrealengine.com/" class="text-link"
    >official Unreal Engine communities</a
  >
  for a chapter near you. If they don't have one yet, consider starting one!
  They're all volunteer-led.
</p>

<p class="paragraph paragraph-spacer">
  For other related local communities, for example, gamedev, indie dev, virtual
  production, etc., check and/or ask on community newsletters, notice boards,
  your location's reddit thread, or
  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/home/" class="text-link">Meetup</a>.
